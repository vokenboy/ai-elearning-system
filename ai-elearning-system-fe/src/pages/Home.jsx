            questions, which include coding challenges, multiple-choice queries,
            and real-time problem-solving tasks. <br />
            The AI engine intelligently analyzes the learners' responses, identifies
            areas where they may need improvement, and recommends targeted lessons
            or additional practice to help them progress effectively. <br />
            It also provides instant feedback, explanations, and hints to guide
            users as they navigate through different topics, ensuring an effective
            learning experience. <br />
            Additionally, the system offers performance analytics, tracking learnersâ€™
            strengths and weaknesses, and enabling instructors or self-learners to
            tailor their study plans accordingly. <br />
            With real-time adaptive learning, this AI-driven platform is an
            invaluable resource for individuals looking to gain proficiency in
            programming languages at any level.
